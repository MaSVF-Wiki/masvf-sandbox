wow! the big window has wiiiiiide margins.

this page created for testing the Ob-Git push "username" 

OK. generated a new personal access token and used it with a successful CL push.
Let's see what happens

And now we opened this massive-wiki on another computer - the laptop `boaz`
And we will update this Zettelkasten here and see what happens when I push it to the repo. (This is the opposite of "repo man".)

Yowza! worked fine.
So I still do not know what happened on my desktop computer `adagio`


### 2021-03-25: quick test on Windows10
- did the usual setup
1. Clone repo using GitHub Desktop (add from repo menu)
2. Add new vault in Obsidian and
3. install Obsidian Git community plugin and
4. set Hotkeys for Pull `ctrl L` and push `ctrl U`

the test is editing this existing note and let's see if we can push it.
