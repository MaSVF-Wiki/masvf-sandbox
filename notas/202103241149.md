wow! the big window has wiiiiiide margins.

this page created for testing the Ob-Git push "username" 

OK. generated a new personal access token and used it with a successful CL push.
Let's see what happens

And now we opened this masvf-wiki on another computer - the laptop `boaz`
And we will update this Zettelkasten here and see what happens when I push it to the repo. (This is the opposite of "repo man".)

Yowza! worked fine.
So I still do not know what happened on my desktop computer `adagio`
