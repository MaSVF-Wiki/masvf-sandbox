<p>Perhaps I can use the Github Desktop app to see what happens when Obsidian-git does its thing?</p>
<p>Stay tuned ....</p>
<p>testing continues.
perhaps we need to look at the logs to see what is happening?
who knows?</p>
<p>No, the Github Desktop logs do not seem to be a place that captures everything that is happening.</p>

<p>One place to look for logs is on GitHub:</p>
<p>https://github.com/MaSVF-Wiki/masvf-sandbox/commits/main</p>
<p>On your desktop with command-line Git, it would be <code>git log</code>. Dunno about GitHub Desktop, though.</p>
