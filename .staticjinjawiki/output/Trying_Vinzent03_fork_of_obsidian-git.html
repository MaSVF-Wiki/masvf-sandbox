<h3>Installing</h3>
<p>How to install Vinzent03's fork of <code>obsidian-git</code>. Since there aren't releases of it yet, we pull from 'master'. Caveat utilitor!</p>
<p>Change directory to your vault's plugin directory.</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git.git cd obsidian-git npm i npm run build</code></p>
<p>Enable plugin within Obsidian.</p>
<h3>Configuring</h3>
<p>(I already have git configured, so nothing for me to do about that.)</p>
<p>I enabled the plugin in Obsidian.</p>
<p>I set hotkeys: I'm trying ⌘L for pull, and ⌘U for push.</p>
<h3>Using (Experiment 1)</h3>
<ul>
<li>yay, ⌘L worked (no updates)</li>
<li>created this page, will try to push</li>
<li>no joy, maybe I need to <code>git add .</code> by hand...</li>
<li>... and maybe even <code>git commit</code> by hand?</li>
<li>okay, adding and committing by hand let the plugin do its push</li>
<li>let's try some added lines (this and one above), maybe now it'll commit</li>
<li>... nope.  Hmm.</li>
<li>I'll add+commit by hand with my Git client, and push again.  Thus ends Experiment 1.</li>
</ul>
