### macOS Massive Wiki new user on-boarding notes
#### Author: Bill Anderson

1. Installed macOS Catalina 10.15.5 in VMware Fusion
	- upgraded to 10.15.7
2. Installed Obsidian
	- started writing these notes
3. Install Obsidian-GIt
   - Enabling Obsidian-Git brings up message suggesting install of command line developer tools.
4. Perhaps use the (official) stand-alone installer for Git on OS-X?
   - this package installs git version 2.15 for Mavericks OS X (behind the current versions)
   - Worse: user needs to circumvent the "unidentified developer" security block message
5. So now we follow instructions for install of command line tools. That proceeded without a hitch.
6. But before we can test Obsidian-Git we need to connect to a Massive Wiki repository.
   - Downloaded GitHub Desktop to access GitHub repositories (N.B. GitHub Desktop download unzips in Downloads directory. Need to move the App to the Applications folder.)
   - Login and set-up GitHub Desktop details (e.g., email)
   - Use GitHub Desktop to Clone a Massive-Wiki repository
   - In Obsidian: set up the repository as another vault (cf., Obsidian instructions in MW Guidebook)
7. Testing the setup so far
   - Copy this note into the MW-sandbox repo and see if we can push it.
