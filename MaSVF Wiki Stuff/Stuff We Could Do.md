- think about .gitignore and Obsidian-Git's tendency to add ALL THE FILES and commit
- play with syncing HackMD and GitHub
    - line breaks
    - just syncing
- make lists and diagrams of the various "good" ways you can interact with the wiki and other people via MaSVF
    - "more than one way"
    - "interaction models"
- play with Typora
- get [[Static Jinja Wiki]] working with Netlify
