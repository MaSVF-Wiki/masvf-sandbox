- Torn between "MaSVF Wiki" and "Massive Wiki".
	- Domain-wise, we will use both masvf.wiki and massive.wiki; one of them will redirect to the other.
- Audience is people who can handle a computer and follow instructions; use plain, understandable language. Explain arcane concepts very briefly, but not in a lot of depth; save that for an intermediate handbook.
- Need to sprinkle in screenshots and diagrams.
- Need to identify additional resources, like Markdown how-tos, Obsidian how-tos, etc.  Videos would be especially nice.
- Primary output formats will be static web site and PDF.  Generally, don't use internal wiki links, there's enough stuff going on already.
- Section numbers in page titles. Make them incrementing integers; it's okay to have to renumber when pages get added or moved.
- Each page will have a [semver](https://semver.org/) version number at the top that represents the release number of the whole guidebook, incremented on each "release" (publication to static site + PDF). There won't be a page-specific version number; just use the git log for that.
