Perhaps I can use the Github Desktop app to see what happens when Obsidian-git does its thing?

Stay tuned ....

testing continues.
perhaps we need to look at the logs to see what is happening?
who knows?

No, the Github Desktop logs do not seem to be a place that captures everything that is happening.
